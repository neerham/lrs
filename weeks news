            <h2>Adrija's Haerin obsession: The beginning of another phase?</h2>
            <p>Adrija Adwitiya, 12, now has another obsession of Kang Haerin, 18. Old readers may remember the past two articles of her obsession with popular kpop group Newjeans and jpop artist Ado. This obsession is very much like the previous ones, perhaps a beginning of another era for Adrija?</p>
            <p>Haerin is an 18-year-old South Korean singer, and the best known member of the popular kpop group Newjeans.</p>
            <p>"Adrija cannot stop talking about Newjeans." Says Mahreen, 13. Another interviewee has told us that Adrija draws green cats everywhere, which are supposed to be a symbol of Haerin. She claims that her notebooks, classworks, stationery and everything are filled with the symbol of Haerin.</p>
            <p>However, Adrija's obsession of Haerin is not necessarily a bad thing, because it makes many good memories between her and her friends.</p>
            <p>"I'm not a fan of kpop, but its really refreshing to sing the Newjeans song with her sometimes." Says Wareesha, 11. In fact, she and her friends have made it a trend to sing the Newjeans song all the time and to have a heartfelt love for Haerin, for Adrija's sake.</p>

            <h2>Tasfia & Zannat have a future ahead of them!</h2>
            <p>Tasfia Akter Anha and Zannatul Fredous Chowdhury have been known as "weirdos" and "furries" by their classmates.</p>
            <p>Zannatul (Or Zannat, as referred to by her classmates) draws furry art for fun in a spare notebook during lectures. Once, when Sumaila asked to see her drawings, Zannat responded with "You're not my friend so you can't see it sumahaila hahaha"</p>
            <p>Tasfia, on the other hand, draws furries on the back of worksheets, resulting in a lot more trouble for her. She has been known to draw furry versions of her classmates, some naked, others wearing undergarments.</p>
            <p>Needless to say, it is easy to assume that they don't have a very bright future ahead of them.</p>
            <p>However, recently, a new website named furryart.com has come into the spotlight for paying artists $70,000 per 10 drawings. Now, this leaves us to speculate that, theoretically, Tasfia and Zannat could make a living off of that, and their futures aren't so bleak after all</p>
            <p>Whether this is a good thing or not, we'll leave you, the reader, to decide.</p>

            <h2>Shrekorgy Returns</h2>
            <p>Recent reports have emerged of a strange figure, dubbed "The Protein-Pill Phantom," wandering the streets begging on his knees for protein pills. He’s been kicked aside repeatedly—until one man found himself stalked by this mysterious figure, resulting in a bizarre hostage situation. But that’s not the strangest part—both men later contracted the “Shrekorgy” which, old readers will know, reportedly causes green discoloration in... well, unfortunate areas. </p>
            <p><strong>Experts warn the public: BEWARE. If you encounter this beggar, don’t kick him. You might catch more than just his attention!</strong></p>
